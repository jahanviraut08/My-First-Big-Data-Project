# My First Big Data Project: NYC Taxi Analysis

This is my beginner project showing how to analyze a **large dataset** (3 million taxi rides) using **PySpark**. It demonstrates scalabilityâ€”PySpark handles big files by splitting them and processing in parallel!

## What It Does
- Loads NYC taxi data (Jan 2023).
- Cleans it (removes bad rows).
- Finds insights: Average fares by hour (peak at evening rush!).
- Makes a chart.


 Total rides analyzed: 3,000,000+.



First projectâ€”learning big data! ðŸš€
